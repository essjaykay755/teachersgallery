Below is a high‐to‐low level plan outlining how to build the backend for TeachersGallery using Supabase for the database, storage (avatars), and authentication. This plan will cover the overall architecture, database schema design, API endpoints, integration with Supabase (including auth and storage), and additional features such as role‐based authorization and admin functions.

---

## 1. Overall Architecture

- **Frontend + Backend Integration:**  
  The UI you’ve built in Next.js (using the App Router) will communicate with an API layer that talks to Supabase. You can use either Next.js API routes or Next.js server actions to act as a secure backend. Many parts (like fetching teacher profiles and reviews) can even be done directly from the client by using the Supabase client libraries (with proper security policies in Supabase).

- **Supabase Services:**

  - **Auth:** Manage user registration and login for teachers, students, and parents.
  - **Database:** Store all application data including user profiles, teacher profiles, reviews, messages, and admin configurations.
  - **Storage:** Upload and serve avatars (and possibly other media/document assets) via a dedicated bucket.

- **Role-Based Access & Security:**  
  Use Supabase’s Row Level Security (RLS) and policies to ensure that only the owner (or an admin) can modify their own profile. Admin endpoints (for managing teachers, reviews, etc.) should require an “admin” role claim.

- **Realtime & Notifications:**  
  Optionally leverage Supabase’s realtime features for live updates (e.g., new messages or review updates) and store notifications for admin review.

## 2. Database Schema Design

### A. Core Tables

1. **Profiles Table (User Profiles):**  
   This table will store the basic user data. It will be linked to Supabase Auth’s user UUID.

   **Suggested Columns:**

   - id (UUID, primary key – same as Supabase auth id)
   - full_name (text)
   - email (text)
   - phone (text)
   - user_type (enum: "teacher", "student", "parent")
   - avatar_url (text; URL pointing to the storage bucket)
   - created_at (timestamp)

2. **Teacher Profiles Table:**  
   Contains additional details specific to teachers. In some cases, you might merge this into the profiles table if only teachers have these extra attributes.

   **Suggested Columns:**

   - id (UUID, primary key)
   - user_id (UUID, foreign key reference to Profiles table)
   - subject (text or JSON array if a teacher has multiple subjects)
   - location (text)
   - fee (text or numeric)
   - about (text, teacher bio)
   - tags (array of text)
   - is_verified (boolean)
   - is_featured (boolean)
   - featured_until (timestamp, if applicable)
   - rating (numeric, optionally computed from the reviews)
   - reviews_count (integer, optionally stored or computed on the fly)
   - students_count (integer, can be aggregated or maintained by the system)
   - created_at (timestamp)

3. **Teacher Experience & Education:**  
   You can choose to store these as JSON arrays within the teacher profile table or split them into separate tables.

   **Example (Separate Table for Experience):**

   - id (serial/UUID primary key)
   - teacher_id (UUID, foreign key)
   - title (text)
   - institution (text)
   - period (text)
   - description (text)

   A similar table can be created for education records.

4. **Reviews Table:**  
   Stores reviews/ratings submitted by students and parents.

   **Suggested Columns:**

   - id (UUID, primary key)
   - teacher_id (UUID, foreign key referencing teacher profiles)
   - reviewer_id (UUID, foreign key referencing profiles)
   - rating (numeric)
   - comment (text)
   - created_at (timestamp)

5. **Messages Table:**  
   Store messages exchanged between students/parents and teachers.

   **Suggested Columns:**

   - id (UUID, primary key)
   - sender_id (UUID, foreign key referencing profiles)
   - receiver_id (UUID, foreign key referencing profiles)
   - message (text)
   - created_at (timestamp)
   - read (boolean)

6. **Featured & Pricing Plans (Optional):**  
   For the admin to manage featured teachers and plans.

   **Featured Listings:**

   - You can add extra fields in the teacher profiles or create a separate table for featured listings which include plan type, duration, and status.

   **Pricing Plans Table:**

   - id (text/UUID)
   - name (text)
   - price (text or numeric)
   - duration (text, e.g., "7 days", "30 days")
   - features (JSON or an array of text)

7. **Notifications (for Admin/Users):**  
   Store notifications such as new teacher signups, verification requests, or reported reviews.

   **Suggested Columns:**

   - id (UUID)
   - type (text/enumeration — e.g., "new_teacher", "verification", "report")
   - title (text)
   - message (text)
   - time (timestamp)
   - read (boolean)
   - action_url (text)
   - severity (enum: "low", "medium", "high")

## 3. API Endpoints & Server Functions

### A. Public / Client-Facing Endpoints

- **Teacher Profiles:**

  - GET `/api/teachers`  
    To list teacher profiles (with filters such as subject, location, fee range, sorting by rating/experience).

  - GET `/api/teachers/[id]`  
    To fetch detailed profile information including bio, experience, education, ratings, and reviews.

  - POST `/api/teachers`  
    For teachers to create their profile after signing up. (This may be invoked as part of the signup flow.)

  - PUT `/api/teachers/[id]`  
    For teachers to update their profile details, change bio, upload new photo, etc.

- **Reviews:**

  - GET `/api/reviews?teacher_id=<teacher id>`  
    List all reviews for a particular teacher.
  - POST `/api/reviews`  
    For students/parents to submit a review. The payload should include teacher_id, reviewer_id, rating, and comment.

- **Messages:**
  - GET `/api/messages?conversation=<id>`  
    Retrieve message history between two users.
  - POST `/api/messages`  
    Send a message. (You could also consider real-time messaging using Supabase’s realtime channel.)

### B. Admin Endpoints

- **User Management:**

  - GET `/api/admin/users`  
    To list and manage all teachers, students, or parents.
  - PUT `/api/admin/users/[id]`  
    For updating user status (e.g., verifying a teacher, marking a teacher as featured).

- **Teacher Management:**

  - GET `/api/admin/teachers`  
    List teacher profiles with the ability to sort/filter by status, featured state, and rating.
  - DELETE `/api/admin/teachers/[id]`  
    To remove a teacher account.

- **Featured Listings & Pricing:**

  - GET/POST/PUT endpoints for managing pricing plans and currently featured teachers.

- **Notifications:**
  - GET `/api/admin/notifications`  
    To list notifications about new signups, reports, and verifications.

_Tip:_ These endpoints can be built as Next.js API routes that internally use the Supabase Admin client. Role-based access (admin only) should be enforced through both route protection and Supabase RLS policies.

## 4. Supabase Integration

### A. Authentication

- Use [Supabase Auth](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth) to handle registration/signin flows.
- On signup, store extra profile details in the “profiles” table.
- Separate teacher-specific details will be added via the `/api/teachers` endpoint.
- Use email confirmation and password recovery built into Supabase.

### B. Database & Row-Level Security

- Set up the tables as described and enable Row Level Security (RLS).
- Create policies to allow:
  - Users to read public teacher profiles.
  - Teachers to update only their own records.
  - Students/parents can only add reviews (and only one per completed session if needed).
  - Admins to bypass these policies using a defined “admin” role.

### C. Storage for Avatars

- Create a Supabase Storage bucket (e.g., “avatars”) for teacher images.
- Use Supabase client libraries in the Next.js registration and account update pages to upload images.
- Store the returned public URL in the “avatar_url” field of the Profile.

### D. Realtime / Serverless Functions (Optional)

- Utilize Supabase Realtime subscriptions to update reviews/messages in real time on the client.
- Create serverless functions (Edge Functions in Supabase) for sending email notifications or processing payments for featured listings if needed.

## 6. Summary

- Use Supabase’s Auth for registration and login, with role-based policies for teachers, students, and parents.
- Design a relational database schema covering user profiles, teacher profiles (with additional details like experience and education), reviews, messages, and admin tables for featured listings and notifications.
- Store media (teacher avatars) in Supabase Storage.
- Develop a set of API endpoints (public and admin) in Next.js that interact with Supabase using secure, RLS-enforced queries.
- Leverage realtime features (or serverless functions) to provide dynamic notifications and updates for messages or reviews.
- Follow a structured roadmap, starting with Supabase configuration and backend schema, then progressively build and integrate the API layer before final frontend integration and testing.

This plan should give you a clear path to completing the backend of TeachersGallery while complementing your existing UI work.
