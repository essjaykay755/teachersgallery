# Registration Fix Summary

## The Problem

During the registration process, we encountered two main issues:

1. **Avatar Upload Error**: The avatar upload was successful, but the user didn't have permission to upload to the avatars bucket due to RLS policies.

2. **Profile Creation Error**: After successful avatar upload, the user couldn't create a profile due to missing INSERT policy on the profiles table.

## The Solution

We implemented a comprehensive solution that addresses both issues:

### 1. Server-Side API Endpoint

Created a new API endpoint at `app/api/register/route.ts` that:

- Handles user registration through Supabase Auth
- Uses a service role key to bypass RLS policies
- Creates the user profile and teacher profile (if applicable)
- Returns appropriate success/error responses

### 2. Updated Registration Forms

Modified all registration handlers in `app/register/page.tsx` to:

- Use the new API endpoint instead of direct Supabase client calls
- Handle avatar uploads with temporary IDs before user creation
- Implement proper error handling and user feedback
- Sign in the user after successful registration

### 3. Enhanced Avatar Upload

Improved the `uploadAvatar` function in `lib/upload.ts` to:

- Generate a unique ID if no user ID is provided
- Check if the avatars bucket exists and create it if needed
- Provide better error handling and logging
- Handle RLS policy errors gracefully

### 4. Added RLS Policies

Created SQL scripts and documentation for adding necessary RLS policies:

- Added INSERT policy for the profiles table
- Documented the process in `MANUAL_POLICY_SETUP.md`
- Created `supabase/add-profiles-insert-policy.sql` for manual execution

## Required Manual Steps

To complete the fix, you need to:

1. **Apply Profiles INSERT Policies**:

   - Go to the Supabase dashboard
   - Navigate to the profiles table
   - Add the INSERT policies as described in `MANUAL_POLICY_SETUP.md`

2. **Verify Storage Policies**:
   - Ensure the avatars bucket exists
   - Check that the storage policies allow uploads

## Testing

After applying these changes and the manual steps, the registration process should work correctly:

1. User fills out the registration form
2. Avatar is uploaded successfully
3. User account is created
4. Profile is created
5. User is signed in and redirected to the home page
